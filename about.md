I am a ceramic and beading artist from the Pacific Northwest and am drawn to the intersection of function and artistic expression.  Introduced to both wheel throwing and beading at a young age by my grandmother, I have been learning and refining my work for the past two decades.  


My ceramic pieces tend towards functional ware and utilitarian items that embrace the symmetry that is inherent in throwing pots as well as altering and adjusting that precision.  My beaded jewelry comparatively is often multi-stranded or asymmetrical statement pieces.  They are made from both recycled components and items found or purchased both locally and internationally.  Each unique piece is a collage celebrating the experiences and places the where the beads were sourced.  I enjoy the flexibility of both art forms and the ability to play, experiment, and, if not content with the product, take it apart and start again.
