I am a ceramic and beading artist from the Pacific Northwest and am drawn to the intersection of function and artistic expression.  Introduced to both wheel throwing and beading at a young age by my grandmother, I have been learning and refining my work for the past two decades.  


My ceramic pieces tend towards functional items that embrace the symmetry that is inherent in throwing pots while also exploring altering and adjusting that precision to create pieces that blend utility and sculpture.  Comparatively, my beaded jewelry is often multi-stranded or asymmetrical statement pieces.  Made from both recycled components and items I've collected at markets, garage sales, and traditional bead stores both locally and internationally.  Each unique piece is a collage celebrating the experiences and places where the beads were sourced.  I enjoy the flexibility of both art forms and the ability to play, experiment, and, if not content with the product, take it apart and start again.
