A commissioned piece, this lamp is one of a pair- along with <a href="../Emerald_Basin_Cairn_Lamp/">Emerald Basin</a> - of bed-side table lamps.  The beginning of my cairn series and made up of seven individually glazed jewel-toned spheres, this lamp is insipired by hiking cairns the direction that they, and light, can provide for those who wander.
