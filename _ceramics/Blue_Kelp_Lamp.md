Created during an Artist in Residence at [Alchemy Art Center](https://alchemyartcenter.com/) on San Juan Island this lamp continues my Rocks and Pots lamp series.  Decorated with carvings, layers of glaze, and stacks of stone-inspire-balls this pot nods at an underwater world while illuminating any room.
