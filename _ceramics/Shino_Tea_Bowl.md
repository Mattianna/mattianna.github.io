These bowls began my faceting series.  Made with high fired porcelain, they are made by faceting a narrow cylinder and then opening the bowl causing the facets to twist around the pot.  Glazed with a high fire shino, they epitomize the best of the glaze with carbon trapping resulting in blacks and greys on the outside and the classic shino orange on the inside.  While clearly a set, each piece is unique.
