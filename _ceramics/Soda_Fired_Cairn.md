This high fire stoneware lamp is a continuation of my cairn series. The “stone” elements of this base are decorated with a colored slip which interacts with the iron content within the clay of the forms themselves. This combination of elements, while being fired in a soda kiln, result in the dramatic coloration of this beautiful lamp. It is earthy and grounded while towering and lighting the way.
