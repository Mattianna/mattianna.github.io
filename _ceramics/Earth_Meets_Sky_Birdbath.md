This birdbath was a collaborative project with my mother the metal artist [Alisa Roe](https://www.afroemetalwork.com/).  Made as a present for my father, its base combines recylced tractor parts with fabricated components to create an interesting pedestal to support a slab build wide undulating ceramic basin.
