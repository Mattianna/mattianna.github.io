This necklace is made combining glass opalescent beads from China, an assortment of silver pieces from recycled necklaces and beads bought in India. These featured beads are set amongst a variety of black and silver beads resulting in a beautiful asymmetrical composition of 10 strands. It is one of my favorites.
